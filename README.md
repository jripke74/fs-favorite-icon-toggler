Build a Favorite Icon Toggler
Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

In this lab you will use JavaScript click events to toggle the appearance of a favorite icon. When the heart icon is clicked, the appearance of the heart changes from empty to filled, and vice versa.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:

1. You should have an unordered list with three items.
2. The unordered list should have the class item-list.
3. The three list items should contain the item name followed by a span element with the class 4.4.favorite-icon.
4. The span element should contain the code &#9825; initially to represent an empty heart.
5. When a span element containing a heart is clicked, you should add the filled class to the clicked span if it's not already present, and remove it, if it is.
6. When a span element containing a heart is clicked, the heart symbol should toggle between &#9825; (empty heart) and &#10084; (filled heart), depending on its current state.
